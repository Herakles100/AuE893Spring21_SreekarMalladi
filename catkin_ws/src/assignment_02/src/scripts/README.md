For assignment 2, 3 python scripts were made.
The first script, 'assignment2_circle.py' makes the turtlesim move in a circular path by giving it a constant angular and linear velocity whose values are equal so that the turtlesim follows a circular path.

The second script, 'assignment2_olsquare.py' makes the turtlesim follow a square path but by velocity control. The time for the bot to move and then rotate is calculated and if-loops are used to control its trajector and velocity.

The third script, 'assignment2_clsquare.py' makes the turtlesim follow a square path but by using the go-to-goal function example that is provided in the ROS wiki. It forces the turtlesim to correct its pose and go to the require coordinates.
